        Rebuild every hour from `heal_since` onward.

        Mixes this poll's fresh readings with whatever's already stored for
        hours this poll didn't return. Fixes a gap class the plain
        append-only push (see
        _async_push_hourly_statistic) can't: Watercare's API has been
        observed to return a sparse set of half-hourly readings for a day
        that still includes the 23:30 reading, so _bucket_hourly_readings
        correctly calls the day complete, but the resulting push is missing
        whichever hours weren't in that response -- and since the watermark
        only advances, a later poll with a fuller response for the same day
        could never fill them in. Recomputing the whole window from an
        anchor before it and upserting (async_add_external_statistics
        updates an existing point for a given start rather than duplicating
        it) means a hole from one poll's sparse response gets healed the
        next time the API returns more for that hour, with no risk of
        clobbering an hour this poll didn't see: those keep their already-
        stored sum via `existing_sums`, they're just not re-sent as-is --
        see the delta carry-forward below for why they can still change.

        Any `hourly_consumption` hour before `heal_since` is ignored -- it's
        outside the window `anchor_sum` accounts for, so folding it into the
        running sum would double-count it against whatever's already stored
        there.

        `fresh_hours` marks which hours actually changed this poll and
        should be recomputed from `hourly_consumption`; every other hour
        carries its existing stored sum forward instead (see `delta`
        below). Defaults to every hour with a reading this poll -- the
        right behavior for the plain consumption series, where "has a
        reading" and "may have changed" are the same thing. Cost series
        pass the *consumption* series' own touched-hour set instead: cost
        is a pure function of litres and the currently configured rate, so
        recomputing it for the whole window unconditionally would silently
        rewrite already-published cost history the moment the user changes
        a rate, even for hours whose litres never changed. Restricting to
        the hours consumption actually touched means only a genuine litres
        change (fresh data, or a delta cascading from an earlier fix, see
        below) can move cost history -- a rate change alone can't.

        A hole (no fresh, unrestricted reading this hour) carries forward
        via `delta`: the gap between the running sum this function has
        just computed and the sum that was already stored for the last
        hour it touched. Without this, healing an earlier hour upward (or
        downward) while a later hour in the same window goes untouched
        would leave the later hour's stored sum unchanged -- producing a
        non-monotonic sum sequence (a decreasing "cumulative" total) the
        moment the two are compared, e.g. in the Energy dashboard. Shifting
        every untouched hour by the same delta keeps the whole window
        internally consistent, and reduces to a no-op (delta stays 0, no
        extra writes) whenever nothing needed correcting.

        A recomputed hour whose sum comes out unchanged from what's already
        stored (within floating-point tolerance -- cost series in
        particular can re-derive a value a rounding ULP off from the
        original even when nothing actually changed) is left out of the
        returned points -- healing re-touches the whole window every poll,
        so without this most hours would upsert a functionally-unchanged
        value every single time.
